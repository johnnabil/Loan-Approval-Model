## Introduction

The objective of this project is to provide insights into loan approval data through dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques, followed by evaluating various classification models. The steps include:
1. Data preprocessing
2. Applying PCA for dimensionality reduction
3. Using K-Means clustering to determine optimal clusters
4. Evaluating classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes) based on performance metrics

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis contains information on loan applications, including features that may affect the approval status of the loan. Key attributes include applicant details, loan amount, credit history, etc.
